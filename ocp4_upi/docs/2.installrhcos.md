# Install RHCOS

Using the bios file you downloaded and the ISO file; you'll install RHCOS on all 6 servers (the 3 masters, 2 wokers, 1 bootstrap). Procedure is easy. 

Boot into the ISO and when you're presented with this screen hit `TAB`

![RHCOS_BOOT](rhcos.png)

For each server do the following

**NOTE** The IP address you're using is either your laptop (the "python" method) or your webserver (the "apache" method)

# Bootstrap

For the bootstrap server; when you press `TAB` enter the following all on one line (change the port if you're running on something other than `8080`)

```
coreos.inst.install_dev=sda coreos.inst.image_url=http://192.168.1.27:8080/rhcos-4.1.0-x86_64-metal-bios.raw.gz coreos.inst.ignition_url=http://192.168.1.27:8080/install/bootstrap.ign 
```

This will install the server "unattended". It will set the IP to whatever you set it in DHCP. So it's IMPORTANT that you set up the right MAC address in your dhcp "static ip" config.

# Masters

For the master servers; when you press `TAB` enter the following all on one line (change the port if you're running on something other than `8080`)

```
coreos.inst.install_dev=sda coreos.inst.image_url=http://192.168.1.27:8080/rhcos-4.1.0-x86_64-metal-bios.raw.gz coreos.inst.ignition_url=http://192.168.1.27:8080/install/master.ign
```

This will install the server "unattended". It will set the IP to whatever you set it in DHCP.

# Workers

For the workers; press `TAB` enter the following all on one line (change the port if you're running on something other than `8080`)

```
coreos.inst.install_dev=sda coreos.inst.image_url=http://192.168.1.27:8080/rhcos-4.1.0-x86_64-metal-bios.raw.gz coreos.inst.ignition_url=http://192.168.1.27:8080/install/worker.ign
```

This will install the server "unattended". It will set the IP to whatever you set it in DHCP.

# Troubleshooting

Any issues that come up; you can view it in your bootstrap server. SSH using `core` user and running the `journalctl -b -f -u bootkube.service` command

```
$ ssh bootstrap.ocp4.example.com -l core
Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS 410.8.20190516.0
WARNING: Direct SSH access to machines is not recommended.
This node has been annotated with machineconfiguration.openshift.io/ssh=accessed

---
This is the bootstrap node; it will be destroyed when the master is fully up.

The primary service is "bootkube.service". To watch its status, run e.g.

  journalctl -b -f -u bootkube.service
Last login: Wed May 22 19:30:48 2019 from 192.168.1.254
[systemd]
Failed Units: 1
  systemd-firstboot.service
[core@bootstrap ~]$ journalctl -b -f -u bootkube.service
```

Also remember to keep the LB status page up. You'll see that it's all red for now. Keep this up during the OCP4 install

```
firefox http://api.ocp4.example.com:9000/
```

# Conclusion

Now you're ready to install OCP4
