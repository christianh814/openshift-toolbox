# Installl OCP4

Once you've installed RHCOS on the bootstrap server, the masters, and the workers; you are ready to begin the install process.

# Bootstrapping

In fact...the cluster is already installing! This is what the boostrap server does. But you can monitor it via the following command

```
cd ${HOME}
openshift-install --log-level=debug --dir=install wait-for bootstrap-complete
```

This waits until the Kubernetes APIServer signals that it has been bootstrapped on the control plane machines.

**NOTE** After this completes...REMOVE the boostrap machine from the loadbalancer and restart the `haproxy` service!

At this point the base cluster is installed and you can connect to it

Export the kubeconfig file
```
export KUBECONFIG=${HOME}/install/auth/kubeconfig
```

Use the cli tools

```
$ oc whoami
system:admin
```

> You *MIGHT* need to approve the certs outlined [here](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-bare-metal.html#installation-approve-csrs_installing-bare-metal). Test this with `oc get csr` and see if you see `Pending`.

# Operators install

At this point operators are being installed...you can take a look with the following

```
oc get clusteroperators
```

This will take some time. Also, the registry operator is waiting for you to provide some storage. For now set it to `emptyDir`

```
oc patch configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io cluster --type merge --patch '{"spec":{"storage":{"emptyDir":{}}}}'
```

You can watch the operators finish or use the `install-complete` option to track it

# Complete Install

Run the following to monitor the operator installation

```
cd ${HOME}
openshift-install --log-level=debug --dir=install wait-for install-complete
```

# PROFIT

You did it! 

```
$ oc get nodes
